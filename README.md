  The Ultimate Mode in <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em> is heavily inspired by <strong>Sonic Frontiers'</strong> Extreme mode.<br>
  In this mode, there are <strong>no Rings</strong> or <strong>checkpoints</strong>. You <strong>cannot take any damage</strong> or you will restart the stage from the beginning.<br>
  There are many platforms that have been moved or are nonexistent. Shadow's <strong>Spin Dash</strong> will now be very useful in the stages.<br>
  Advance and find all the <strong>Chaos Emeralds</strong> that are scattered throughout the <strong>23 stages</strong>.

# Adaptation for the Co-Op Multiplayer Mod

All stages of the game are adaptable for the [2P Co-Op Multiplayer](https://github.com/ShadowTheHedgehogHacking/2P-Reloaded) Mod. 

That means you can play with your partner without any problems and there will be no need to adapt for the second player.
Just download the 2P Multiplayer mod and play using the latest Ultimate Mode files.

# Installation Note

It is recommended that you copy all the files from the folders as they are, so as not to transfer the changes made in Ultimate Mode to the singleplayer levels of the game.

In addition, since Ultimate Mode was built using the latest version of [Reloaded](https://github.com/ShadowTheHedgehogHacking/ShdTH-Reloaded.git), it is highly recommended that you install the mod over it to ensure full compatibility and avoid issues.
