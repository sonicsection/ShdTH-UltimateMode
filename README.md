  The Ultimate Mode in <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em> is heavily inspired by <strong>Sonic Frontiers'</strong> Extreme mode.<br>
  In this mode, there are <strong>no Rings</strong> or <strong>checkpoints</strong>. You <strong>cannot take any damage</strong> or you will restart the stage from the beginning.<br>
  There are many platforms that have been moved or are nonexistent. Shadow's <strong>Spin Dash</strong> will now be very useful in the stages.<br>
  Advance and find all the <strong>Chaos Emeralds</strong> that are scattered throughout the <strong>24 stages</strong>.

# Adaptation for the Co-Op Multiplayer Mod

All stages of the game are adaptable for the 2-player Co-Op Multiplayer Mod:  
🔗 [2P Reloaded - Co-Op Multiplayer Mod](https://github.com/ShadowTheHedgehogHacking/2P-Reloaded)

That means you can play with your partner without any problems and there will be no need to adapt for the second player.  
Just download the 2P Multiplayer mod and play using the latest Ultimate Mode files.

# Installation Note

It is recommended that you copy all the files from the folders as they are, so as not to transfer the changes made in Ultimate Mode to the singleplayer levels of the game.

In addition, since Ultimate Mode was built using the latest version of **Shadow the Hedgehog Reloaded**, it is highly recommended that you install the mod over it to ensure full compatibility and avoid issues.

# About the Texture Compilation
When Ultimate Mode was created, the idea arose to share the compilation of textures used at that time for anyone who wanted to find a faster way to play Shadow with good resolution and full textures. Creating all of this from scratch would be laborious and would result in a result similar to the HD Upscaled Texture Pack, it wouldn't be worth it, but even combining the best of each texture available in the community, I had to create some textures that were missing in some stages, as they were exclusive to the Reloaded version (Central City, The Doom, Heavy Dog (Boss) and Final Haunt). It is recommended that anyone using this compilation of textures view the texture on its original creator's page, as not all of their textures were used in this compilation. The credits will be available both on the mod's page on Gamebanana and in the folder of these textures, on Google Drive. So if someone downloads them from another place, they will have access to these credits when opening this folder.
