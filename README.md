  In this mode, there are <strong>no Rings</strong> or <strong>checkpoints</strong>. You <strong>cannot take any damage</strong> or you will restart the stage from the beginning.<br>
  There are many platforms that have been moved or are nonexistent. Shadow's <strong>Spin Dash</strong> will now be very useful in the stages.<br>
  Advance and find all the <strong>Chaos Emeralds</strong> that are scattered throughout the <strong>23 stages</strong>.
